Welcome to our Hyper Casual Bowling Game! In this unique gaming experience, you control a bowling ball navigating a flat surface. Your objective is to grow and shrink the ball by passing through walls embedded with mathematical expressions, overcoming obstacles along the way. Successfully navigate through these challenges to knock down pins at the end of the level, earning points for each pin you topple. This game combines elements of strategy, skill, and a bit of math to provide an engaging and fun experience for players of all ages.
